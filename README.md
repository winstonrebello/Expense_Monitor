# Expense_Monitor
Desktop software whch is built using pyhton and pyqt designer

INTRODUCTION
In todayâ€™s busy and expensive life we are in a great rush to make money. But at the end of the month
we broke off. As we are unknowingly spending money on little and unwanted things. So, I have come
over with the idea to track our earnings.
Expense Monitor (EM) aims to help everyone who is planning to know their expenses and save from
it. EM is a Desktop application where a user can execute in their laptop /pc and update their daily
expenses so that they are well known to their expenses. Here users can define their own categories for
expense type like food, clothing, bills etc. where they have to enter the money that has been spent and
also they can add a date and information to specify the expense. Users can also define expense
categories. Users will be able to see pie charts, bar graphs of their income and expenses. Although this
application is focused on new job holders, interns, teenagers and everyone who wants to track their
expenses can use this application.
Every day Expense Monitor is intended to monitor Income-Expense of a user on an everyday premise.
This System separates the Income-based daily expenses. On the off chance that you surpass the day's
cost, the system will cut it from your Income and will give a new everyday cost permitted sum.
Expense Monitor can generate a csv file of expense in a particular month to show Income-Expense
Curve. It will let you add the savings amount which you had saved for some particular Festivals or
day like Birthday or Anniversary.
